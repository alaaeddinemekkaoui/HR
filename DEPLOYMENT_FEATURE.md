# Completed Tasks Summary

## âœ… Task 1: Add IAV Logo to Browser Tab
**Status: COMPLETE**

- Added favicon link in `templates/base.html`
- Uses existing `static/iav.png` file
- Logo now appears in browser tab

## âœ… Task 2: Fix AttributeError in Grade Change Form
**Status: FIXED**

### Problem:
`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '_prefetch_related_lookups'`
- Occurred at `/employees/2/history/grade-change/`
- Form field `new_grade` had `queryset=None`
- View wasn't passing `employee` parameter to form

### Solution:
1. **Updated `apps/employees/forms/history_forms.py`**:
   - Always initialize `new_grade` queryset in `__init__`
   - Made `new_grade` field `required=False`
   - Added safety check for `employee.grade` existence

2. **Updated `apps/employees/views/history_views.py`**:
   - Pass `employee=employee` parameter to `GradeChangeForm` in both GET and POST methods
   - Fixed field name inconsistency: changed `notes` to `note` to match form field

## âœ… Task 3: Deployment (DÃ©placement) Feature
**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Overview:
Created complete deployment/travel allowance system with two types:

1. **DÃ©placement Forfaitaire** (Fixed Monthly Allowance)
2. **DÃ©placement RÃ©el** (Actual Expenses)

### Components Created:

#### 1. Models (`apps/employees/models/deployment.py`):
- **GradeDeploymentRate**: Default rates per grade (daily & monthly)
  - Tracks historical rate changes
  - `get_current_rate(grade)` class method

- **DeploymentForfaitaire**: Fixed monthly allowance
  - Fields: employee, month, amount, status, approval tracking
  - Unique constraint: one per employee per month
  - Auto-stores default amount for reference

- **DeploymentReal**: Actual travel expenses
  - Fields: employee, start_date, end_date, location, purpose, daily_rate, total_amount
  - Auto-calculates days and total amount
  - Flexible: can use daily rate Ã— days OR direct total amount

#### 2. Forms (`apps/employees/forms/deployment_forms.py`):
- **GradeDeploymentRateForm**: Manage grade rates (HR Admin)
- **DeploymentForfaitaireForm**: Request fixed monthly allowance
  - Auto-fills default amount based on employee grade
  - Validates month uniqueness

- **DeploymentRealForm**: Request actual travel expenses
  - Auto-fills default daily rate
  - Auto-calculates number of days
  - Auto-calculates total amount if daily rate provided
  - Validates date ranges

- **DeploymentReviewForm**: Approve/reject requests (HR Admin)

#### 3. Views (`apps/employees/views/deployment_views.py`):

**Employee Views:**
- `DeploymentListView`: My deployments (both types) with statistics
- `DeploymentForfaitaireCreateView`: Create forfaitaire request
- `DeploymentRealCreateView`: Create real deployment request

**HR Admin Views:**
- `DeploymentApprovalListView`: Pending & reviewed deployments
- `DeploymentForfaitaireReviewView`: Approve/reject forfaitaire
- `DeploymentRealReviewView`: Approve/reject real
- `GradeDeploymentRateListView`: View all rates
- `GradeDeploymentRateCreateView`: Create new rate
- `GradeDeploymentRateUpdateView`: Update existing rate

#### 4. URLs (`apps/employees/urls.py`):
```python
/employees/deployments/                      # My deployments list
/employees/deployments/forfaitaire/create/   # Create forfaitaire
/employees/deployments/real/create/          # Create real
/employees/deployments/approval/             # HR approval list
/employees/deployments/forfaitaire/<id>/review/  # Review forfaitaire
/employees/deployments/real/<id>/review/     # Review real
/employees/deployments/rates/                # Manage rates
/employees/deployments/rates/create/         # Create rate
/employees/deployments/rates/<id>/edit/      # Edit rate
```

### Features:

#### DÃ©placement Forfaitaire (Fixed):
1. Employee requests monthly allowance
2. System auto-fills default amount based on grade
3. Employee can modify amount if needed
4. One request per employee per month
5. HR Admin approves/rejects
6. Tracks default vs requested amount

#### DÃ©placement RÃ©el (Actual):
1. Employee enters travel details:
   - Start/end dates
   - Location
   - Purpose
2. System auto-calculates days
3. Two options for amount:
   - **Option A**: Enter daily rate â†’ auto-calc total
   - **Option B**: Enter total amount directly (for additional expenses)
4. System suggests default daily rate from grade
5. HR Admin reviews and approves/rejects

#### Grade Rate Management (HR Admin):
1. Set default rates per grade
2. Track rate history with effective dates
3. Monthly rate for forfaitaire
4. Daily rate for real deployments
5. Multiple rates per grade (historical tracking)

### Workflow:

**Employee:**
1. Navigate to Deployments
2. Choose type (Forfaitaire or RÃ©el)
3. Fill form (auto-filled defaults)
4. Submit request (status: Pending)
5. View status in "My Deployments"

**HR Admin:**
1. View pending requests
2. Click Review on request
3. Approve or Reject with notes
4. System records reviewer and timestamp

### Database Schema:

```sql
-- Grade rates
gradedeploymentrate
  - id, grade_id, daily_rate, monthly_rate
  - effective_date, is_active
  - created_by_id, notes

-- Fixed monthly allowance
deploymentforfaitaire
  - id, employee_id, month, amount, default_amount
  - status, requested_at, requested_by_id
  - reviewed_at, reviewed_by_id, review_notes
  - notes, document_reference

-- Actual expenses
deploymentreal
  - id, employee_id, start_date, end_date

  - reviewed_at, reviewed_by_id, review_notes
  - notes, document_reference
```

### Migrations:
- **Applied**: `0009_deploymentforfaitaire_deploymentreal_and_more.py`
- Creates 3 new tables with indexes

### Status Workflow:
1. **pending**: Initial state, can be edited
2. **approved**: HR approved, locked
3. **rejected**: HR rejected, locked
4. **cancelled**: Employee cancelled

### Permissions:
- **Employees**: Create requests, view own deployments
- **HR Admin/IT Admin**: Approve/reject, manage rates, view all

### Statistics:

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (If Needed):

### Templates to Create:
1. `templates/employees/deployments/my_deployments.html` - List view
2. `templates/employees/deployments/deployment_form.html` - Create form
3. `templates/employees/deployments/approval_list.html` - HR approval
4. `templates/employees/deployments/deployment_review.html` - Review form
5. `templates/employees/deployments/rate_list.html` - Rate management
6. `templates/employees/deployments/rate_form.html` - Rate form

### Seed Data:
Create management command to seed initial grade rates:
```bash
docker compose exec web python manage.py seed_deployment_rates
```

### Integration:
- Add "DÃ©placements" link to navbar
- Add deployment summary to employee detail page
- Add notification system for status changes
