#### Infrastructure:

### 2. JWT Authentication Fix
**Status: Fully Working**

#### Problem:
- JWT endpoints were being redirected to login page (302 status)
- `LoginRequiredMiddleware` was blocking API access
- Token requests returned HTML instead of JSON

#### Solution:
1. **Added `LOGIN_EXEMPT_PATHS` to settings.py**:
   ```python
   LOGIN_EXEMPT_PATHS = [
       '/api/',  # All API endpoints (JWT authentication)
   ]
   ```

2. **Added `permission_classes = [AllowAny]` to `CustomTokenObtainPairView`**:
   - Overrides Django REST Framework's default IsAuthenticated permission
   - Allows unauthenticated users to request tokens

#### Test Results:
✅ All JWT endpoints working:
- `POST /api/auth/token/` - Obtain access & refresh tokens (200 OK)
- `GET /api/auth/me/` - Get current user data with Bearer token (200 OK)
- `POST /api/auth/token/verify/` - Verify token validity (200 OK)
- `POST /api/auth/token/refresh/` - Refresh access token (200 OK)
- Unauthorized requests correctly rejected with 401

#### JWT Features:
- **Token Lifetimes**: 60min access, 7 days refresh
- **Token Blacklisting**: Logout invalidates tokens
- **Rotation**: Refresh tokens rotate on use
- **Custom Claims**: Includes user, employee, groups data
- **Email/Username Login**: Supports both formats

### 3. UI Improvements
**Status: Complete**

#### Navbar Search Bar Removal:
- Removed search form from `base.html`
- Cleaner, more focused navigation
- Search functionality still available on specific pages (e.g., document generator)

#### Document Search Enhancement:
- **Word-by-word progressive search** across 11 fields:
  - Employee: first_name, last_name, employee_id, ppr, cin, email
  - Position: position__name
  - Grade: grade__name
  - Organization: direction__name, division__name, service__name
- **Auto-submit with debouncing** (500ms delay)
- **Submit on Enter key**
- Distinct results, limited to 50 matches
- Helpful placeholder text explaining search capabilities
